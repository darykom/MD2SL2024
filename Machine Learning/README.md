# Machine_Learning
Assignment for the 'Machine Learning' course (MD2SL 23/24).

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook developed for the Machine Learning course in the Master in Data Science and Statistical Learning at the University of Florence (https://www.md2sl.unifi.it/).  
The notebook explores various regression techniques, data analysis, and model evaluation, focusing on:

- Data normalization and scaling
- Bias-variance tradeoff and hyperparameter selection
- Cross-validation and model behavior across different splits
- Residual distribution analysis
- Effects of model complexity in polynomial regression

## Repository Contents
- `notebook.ipynb`: Notebook containing analysis and code
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project

## Running the Notebook
To run the notebook locally, ensure that you have **Jupyter Notebook** installed.  
Launch it with the command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
